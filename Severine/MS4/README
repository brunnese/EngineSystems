to run download all files in this folder:

- controller4.mat is the controller that worked best on the first testbench session
- tuning can be done in ISC_controller.m

- bode plot and nyquist plot should now be of the right transfer function
- cost is close to one on testbench: 153 on testbench, 176 in simulink

to be done:
- get info on tuning from nyquist and bode
- use controller 4 as a start to get new controllers
- q can be tuned independetly from the other param: good value is q = 0.05. 
- one shouldn't go below 0.05, might be worth it to try q = 0.1
