- controller4.mat is the controller that worked best on the first testbench session
- tuning can be done in ISC_controller.m

- bode plot and nyquist plot should now be of the right transfer function
- cost is close to one on testbench: 153 on testbench, 176 in simulink

to be done:
- get info on tuning from nyquist and bode
- use controller 4 as a start to get new controllers
- q can be tuned independetly from the other param: good value is q = 0.05. 
- one shouldn't go below 0.05, might be worth it to try q = 0.1 


controller:
- controller1: Ki = 5.5, r1 = 2.0, r2= 0.01 q = 0.05
- controller2: KI = 6, r1 = 2.0, r2 = 0.005, q = 0.05
- controller3: KI = 4, r1 = 1.5, r2 = 0.01, q = 0.03
- controller4: KI = 4, r1 = 2, r2 = 0.01, q = 0.05
- controller5: Ki = 5.5, r1 = 2, r2 = 0.01, q = 0.03
