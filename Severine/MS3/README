download all files:

- new par.m file with const p_a, p_e and other simulation param
- simulation is the simulink file that includes the controller and an update version of non linear model
- mat file for linearized system matrices

first tuning done - Ki, r1, r2 and q with trajectory from dynamic_0001.mat

- I sent a first controller to Pol, which you find in controller1.mat

Controllers:
controller1.mat : Ki = 8, r1 = 1.5, r2 = 0.05, q = 0.05     --> medium observer, medium control
controller2.mat : Ki = 12, r1 = 2, r2 = 0.01 q = 0.01.      --> fast observer, aggressive control
controller3.mat : Ki = 12, r1 = 2, r2 = 0.01 q = 0.1        --> slower observer, aggressive control

next steps:
- look at bode plot --> (I think in there is an error in my transfer function) 
  and I don't know which tranfer function has to have crossover frequency under 4 rad/s
- find robustness
- simulate observer only to see what it's doing
- with load on and off
- tune with different gains so that we can test different controller
