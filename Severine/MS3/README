download all files:

- new par.m file with const p_a, p_e and other simulation param
- simulation is the simulink file that includes the controller and an update version of non linear model
- mat file for linearized system matrices

first tuning done - Ki, r1, r2 and q

next steps:
- look at bode plot --> (I think in there is an error in my transfer function) 
  and I don't know which tranfer function has to have crossover frequency under 4 rad/s
- tune with a simple trajectory (steps and ramps)
- find robustness
- simulate observer only to see what it's doing
